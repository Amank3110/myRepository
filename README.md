# MapUp - Python Assessment

## Overview

Great news! I've successfully completed the MapUp Python Assessment, showcasing my proficiency in Python programming, data manipulation, and Excel. Below is a detailed summary of my solutions for each task:

## Python Task 1

### Question 1: Car Matrix Generation
Implemented the `generate_car_matrix` function, generating a DataFrame with values from `id_2` as columns, `id_1` as index, and diagonal values set to 0.

### Question 2: Car Type Count Calculation
Created the `get_type_count` function, adding a new categorical column `car_type` and calculating the count of occurrences for each category. The result is a sorted dictionary.

### Question 3: Bus Count Index Retrieval
Implemented `get_bus_indexes` to identify indices where `bus` values are greater than twice the mean value of the `bus` column.

### Question 4: Route Filtering
Developed the `filter_routes` function, returning a sorted list of `route` values where the average of `truck` column values is greater than 7.

### Question 5: Matrix Value Modification
Created `multiply_matrix` to modify values based on specified logic, rounding to 1 decimal place.

### Question 6: Time Check
Implemented a function to verify the completeness of time data in `dataset-2.csv`, returning a boolean series for each unique (`id`, `id_2`) pair.

## Python Task 2

### Question 1: Distance Matrix Calculation
Developed `calculate_distance_matrix` to generate a symmetric DataFrame representing cumulative distances between IDs, with diagonal values set to 0.

### Question 2: Unroll Distance Matrix
Implemented `unroll_distance_matrix` to transform the distance matrix into a DataFrame with columns `id_start`, `id_end`, and `distance`.

### Question 3: Finding IDs within Percentage Threshold
Created `find_ids_within_ten_percentage_threshold` to calculate average distance for a reference value and return a sorted list within a 10% threshold.

### Question 4: Calculate Toll Rate
Developed `calculate_toll_rate` to calculate toll rates based on vehicle types and add corresponding columns to the input DataFrame.

### Question 5: Calculate Time-Based Toll Rates
Implemented `calculate_time_based_toll_rates` to calculate toll rates for different time intervals within a day, considering weekdays and weekends.

## Excel Assessment

Successfully completed the Excel assessment, demonstrating expertise in Conditional Formatting, Excel Formulae, and Data Manipulation. The solutions are available in the `excel_assessment.xlsm` file.

## Submission

I've organized my submission as per the provided guidelines. The repository contains a `submission` folder with Python scripts (`python_task_1.py` and `python_task_2.py`) and the Excel file (`excel_assessment.xlsm`). Collaborators have been added, and I'm ready to submit the repository link via the provided Google Form.

I appreciate the opportunity to showcase my skills in this assessment. If there are any questions or need for clarification, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
Aman Kumar
